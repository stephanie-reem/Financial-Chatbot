        "context": "\"The Psychology of Money\" by Morgan Housel is an engaging book that explores how our emotions and thinking affect our financial decisions. It explains the complex ways our feelings, biases, and perceptions influence our relationship with money. Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do.",

This aligns with Housel's emphasis on behavior over knowledge, highlighting the importance of patience and discipline in wealth accumulation."
